## IndyLab

IndyLab turns TrailMarks from a personal Informatiomn/Knwoledge/Research Management  tool into a Symmathetic Serendipity Engine supporting personal first collaborative (knowledge) work and bootstrapping, co-metadesigning, tinkerable homebrew tools needed for creating new kinds of software as a conversation

Preaparing for the [Browsers 3000 Hackathon](https://browsers3000.devpost.com/?ref_feature=challenge&ref_medium=your-open-hackathons&ref_content=Submissions+open)!

Proved to be too ambitious and nebulous. Talked to People and they Want IndyWiki (wiky) yesterday!

In fact [Indywiki](https://github.com/IndyVerse/indywiki#readme) is at the center of  the first flower on this infinite Penrose Tiles of capabilites for Structure and Collaboration

The stone you need to cook your own stone soups for your own communities,

powered by WebNative constellations (see [Fission](https://fission.codes)) for creating no code, no deploy,

_collaborative, mutual learning, research spaces_

for Autonomous Networked Improvement Communities on Web3

that are extensible and/or interoperable with other 
Open, Commons-based Peer-produced WebNative Apps

The goal is to "Make it all easy to emulate,
compelling to do" [Jerry Michalsky Open Global Mind](https://hyp.is/ytzAKvXGEeurRiMRiP6Hnw/docdrop.org/video/54iZWI9Does/)

let 1000 ANICs bloom

As with protocols like IPFS, the goal is not to make money with it but because it exists â€”like the Wiki was for Web2, aspiring to do likewise for Web3.

Like the Wiki we want to invent a new ways of writing, InterPersonal communication that is continuous, permanent, with immutable provenance that includes discovering people who read what you write, commenting, suggesting, and learning together in ways that are continuous without being synchronous. With ability to resume knwork and dialogue within a live context where it was last left off. Sharing ideas not as immitation of paper, but in a form that supports faster, better comprehension and the ability to
augment our ability to articulate.
This new way of writing involves the introduction of a new notation that allow us to capture the semantic intent, and our mutual learning (symmathesy) as we write.


IndieHub as TrailHub has been spun out of TrailMarks to create constellations needed for Open, Commons based peer produuction of knowledge along with the very means needed to curate it in ways that augment our ability to think previously unthinkable thoughts, organize them in ways that were previously simply impossible to create "New Kinds of Knowledge" to support collaborative Intentions.


Turn Single Player, Personal Information/Knowledge Management, 
Personal Knowledge Graphs and other Networked Tools for Thought into
ones that are multiplayer, born interoperable and support deep collaborations,
that make the work continuous without being synchronous,
and contiguous with participants own(ed) entire ongoing knowledge work.

Make it easy for anyone with a good idea to create new multiplayer collaborative co-creative tools and capabilities.


Drawn inspiration for the word Lab in the name from
[Collective Intelligence collaboratory](https://www.collectiveintelligencecollaboratory.com/)
and

[Introducing RoamLab: A Framework for Building Community Labs])https://www.kylestratis.com/post/introducing-roamlab-a-framework-for-building-community-labs_

as an Open Framework of building online community laboratories that can be run alongside existing web presence as a Web3 Native Sidecar with zero friction onramping
