End-to-End First Slice Technology Demonstrator of 


how WebNative constellations (see [Fission](https://fission.codes)
can be created for
collaborative, mutual learning, research and building spaces for 
Autonomous Networked Improvement Communities on Web3.
Powered bu IPFS, OrbitDb and Fission to being with.

The goal is to 

"Make it all easy to emulate,
compelling to do" [Jerry Michalsky Open Global Mind](https://hyp.is/ytzAKvXGEeurRiMRiP6Hnw/docdrop.org/video/54iZWI9Does/)

let 1000 ANICs bloom

As with protolocs like IPFS,
the goal is not to make money with it but because it exists

Like the Wiki was for Web 2

Aspiring to do likewise for Web3

IndieHub as TrailHub has been spun out of TrailMarks to create constellations needed for
Open, Commons based peer producuction of knowledge along with the very means best suited for 
augmenting our ability to think previously unthinkable thoughts, organize them in waysthat were previously simply new possible to create "New Kinds of Knowledge" to support collaborative Intentions.


Turn Single Player, Personal Information/Knowledge Management, 
Personal Knowledge Graphs and ather Networked Tools for Thought into
ones that are multiplayer, born interoperable and support deep collaborations,
that make the work continuous without necessarily be sunchronous,
and contigupus with participants own(ed) entire knowledge.
Making it easy for anyone with a good idea to create new 
multiplayer collaborative co-creative tools and capabilities.

IndyLab turns TrailMarks from a personal Inormatiomn/Knwoledge/Research Management  tool into  
a Symmathetic Serendipity Engine support personal first collaborative (knowledge) work and bootstrapping, co-metadesigning, tinkerable homebrew tools needd forcrating new kinds of software as a conversation

Drawn inspiration for the word Lab in the name from
[Collective Intelligence collaboratory](https://www.collectiveintelligencecollaboratory.com/)
and

[Introducing RoamLab: A Framework for Building Community Labs])https://www.kylestratis.com/post/introducing-roamlab-a-framework-for-building-community-labs_

as an Open Framework of building online community laboratories that can be run alongside existing web presence as a
Web3 Native Sidecar with zero friction onramping

Build from Trust for Trust

Restoring the Paradimg Lost
