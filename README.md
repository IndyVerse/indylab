Personal Knowledge Graphs and ather Networked Tools for Thought into
multiplayer collaborative co-creative tools

to provide the same for TrailMarks so that it can become 
a Symmathetic Serendipity Engine support personal first collaborative (knowledge) work and building the rools needd for it as a conversation
